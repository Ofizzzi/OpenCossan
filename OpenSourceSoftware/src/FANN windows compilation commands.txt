First, extract the archive with the modified src\CMakeLists.txt, src\fann_error.c and src\include\fann_error.h in the FANN folder (overwrite the original files).

Then from the Windows SDK/Visual studio command prompt, go to the FANN folder and give:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="E:\workspace\OpenCossan\OpenSourceSoftware\dist\Windows\6.1.7601\win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -G "NMake Makefiles" .
nmake
nmake install

Obviously, the destination dir should be changed automatically to match the cossan external path as initialized from OpenCossan.
Be sure to have the correct VCREDIST that corresponds to the compiler and architecture you used.

Windows 10 64 bit
---------------------------------------------
It is better to use gcc in windows!!!
First, follow this guide to install MSYS and gcc 64bit.
http://ascend4.org/Setting_up_a_MinGW-w64_build_environment
Follow it until "MinGW 32-bit compilers (optional)"

Then, start MSYS and give the commands
cd e:
cd OpenCossan/OpenSourceSoftware/src/FANN-2.2.0-Source
cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/E/OpenCossan/OpenSourceSoftware/dist/Windows/10.0.10586/win64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -G "MSYS Makefiles"

You need to rename the files .dll.a in the destination folder to .lib for compatibility with Matlab mex in windows.
Also, the file libfann.lib should be copied to mex src folder (I have to understand how to set the search path for the .lib)
