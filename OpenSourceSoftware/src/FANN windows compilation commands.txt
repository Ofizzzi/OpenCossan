First, extract the archive with the modified src\CMakeLists.txt, src\fann_error.c and src\include\fann_error.h in the FANN folder (overwrite the original files).

Then from the Windows SDK/Visual studio command prompt, go to the FANN folder and give:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="E:\workspace\OpenCossan\OpenSourceSoftware\dist\Windows\6.1.7601\win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -G "NMake Makefiles" .
nmake
nmake install

Obviously, the destination dir should be changed automatically to match the cossan external path as initialized from OpenCossan.
Be sure to have the correct VCREDIST that corresponds to the compiler and architecture you used.
