 Another ANSYS job with the same job name (suspension_arm_FL) is already running in this
 directory or the suspension_arm_FL.lock file has not been deleted from an abnormally
 terminated ANSYS run.  To disable this check, set the ANSYS_LOCK environment

 Do you wish to override this lock and continue (y or n)?
