%% Definition of Response object

% The response object is used for defining the position in the output file
% where the extraction of the response is has to start. Hence, the
% response object is always used together with an Extractor or
% TableExtractor object.

% For the usage of a Response object with an Extractor object (for single
% output values), the user is referred to the tutorial of Extractor
% -> echodemo TutorialExtractor

% For the usage of a Response object with a TableExtractor object (for
% tabled-valued output), the user is referred to the tutorial of
% TableExtractor
