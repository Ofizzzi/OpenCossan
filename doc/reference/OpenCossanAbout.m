% *About OpenCossan*
%
% OpenCossan Toolbox is the core of the Cossan software. It is programmed in
% a Object Oriented fashion in order to provide flexibility ans extendibility of
% the toolbox. If fact, using this toolbox the users and researchers can modify
% pre-written solution sequences, explore data, implement new algorithms, etc.,
% in other words simply create custom tools, which enable the solution of
% specialised problems.   
% 
% The software offers the most advanced and recent algorithms for the
% rational quantification and propagation of uncertainties. Furthermore, since
% stochastic methods are in general computationally demanding, the resort of
% high performance computing is required in order to reduce the execution time
% (wall clock time) of the analysis. In this regard, the implementations
% available in OpenCossan are coupled with the parallel computing features in
% order to be able to analyse realistic problems within feasible computational
% times. As a result, OpenCossan has evolved as the all-in-one package software
% for the practitioners to perform Uncertainty Quantification,
% Simulation-based Reliability Analysis, Sensitivity Analysis,
% Meta-Modelling and Reliability-Based Optimization.
